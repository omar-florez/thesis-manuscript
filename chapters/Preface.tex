\par Our research theme revolves around the idea of extracting features to
improve the prediction of protein functions. Several parts of this work were
accepted in different academic conferences and symposia. The material in
Chapter \ref{SDAEChapter} can be found in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L. J. V. Miranda} and J. Hu, ``A Deep Learning Approach based
    on Stacked Denoising Autoencoders for Protein Function Prediction,'' in
    \textit{Proceedings of the 42nd IEEE Computer Society Signature Conference
    on Computers, Software, and Applications}, IEEE, July 2018. Note: In press.
    \item \textbf{L. J. V. Miranda} and  J. Hu, ``Feature Extraction using Stacked
    Denoising Autoencoders for Protein Function Prediction,'' in \textit{Proceedings of
    the 11th International Collaboration Symposium on Information, Production,
    and Systems}, November 2017.
\end{itemize}

\par Finally, the material in Chapter \ref{SelectiveChapter} can be found in:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{L. J. V. Miranda} and J. Hu, ``Feature Extraction using a
    Mutually-Competitive Autoencoder for Protein Function Prediction,'' in
    \textit{Proceedings of the IEEE International Conference on System, Man,
    and Cybernetics}, IEEE, October 2018. Note: In press.
\end{itemize}
